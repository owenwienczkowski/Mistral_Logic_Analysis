[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"attends regular gym sessions" -> gym_regular(x)
"experience an increase in physical strength" -> strength_increase(x)
"consumes unhealthy food regularly" -> unhealthy_food(x)
"gains weight" -> weight_gain(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. gym_regular(x) -> strength_increase(x).
2. unhealthy_food(x) -> weight_gain(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Julie'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Julie attends regular gym sessions" -> gym_regular(julie)
"she will not experience weight gain" -> -weight_gain(julie)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. gym_regular(julie) | -weight_gain(julie).

Goal:
The goal is "strength_increase(julie) | -unhealthy_food(julie)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    gym_regular(x) -> strength_increase(x).
    unhealthy_food(x) -> weight_gain(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    gym_regular(julie) | -weight_gain(julie).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    strength_increase(julie) | -unhealthy_food(julie).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "strength_increase(julie) | -unhealthy_food(julie)". This means that Julie will experience an increase in physical strength and will not consume unhealthy food regularly. [end of text]
