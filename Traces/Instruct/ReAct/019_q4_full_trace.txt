[INST] I will translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.

Mapping predicates:
"stores in the fridge" -> stores_in_fridge(x)
"spoils quickly" -> spoils_quickly(x)
"remains fresh for a longer time" -> remains_fresh(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. stores_in_fridge(x) -> remains_fresh(x).
2. spoils_quickly(x) -> -remains_fresh(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"john stores his food in the fridge" -> stores_in_fridge(john)
"it won't spoil quickly" -> -spoils_quickly(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. stores_in_fridge(john) | -spoils_quickly(john).

Goal:
The goal is "remains_fresh(john) | -stores_in_fridge(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    stores_in_fridge(x) -> remains_fresh(x).
    spoils_quickly(x) -> -remains_fresh(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    stores_in_fridge(john) | -spoils_quickly(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    remains_fresh(john) | -stores_in_fridge(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "remains_fresh(john) | -stores_in_fridge(john)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and axioms. [end of text]
