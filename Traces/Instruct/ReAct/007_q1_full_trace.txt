[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"drives recklessly" -> drives_recklessly(x)
"receives a ticket" -> receives_ticket(x)
"drives safely" -> drives_safely(x)
"arrives safely" -> arrives_safely(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. drives_recklessly(x) -> receives_ticket(x).
2. drives_safely(x) -> arrives_safely(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Dave'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Dave drives recklessly" -> drives_recklessly(Dave)
"Dave arrives safely" -> arrives_safely(Dave)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. drives_recklessly(Dave) | arrives_safely(Dave).

Goal:
The goal is "receives_ticket(Dave) | -drives_safely(Dave)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    drives_recklessly(x) -> receives_ticket(x).
    drives_safely(x) -> arrives_safely(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    drives_recklessly(Dave) | arrives_safely(Dave).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    receives_ticket(Dave) | -drives_safely(Dave).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "receives_ticket(Dave) | -drives_safely(Dave)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and axioms. [end of text]
