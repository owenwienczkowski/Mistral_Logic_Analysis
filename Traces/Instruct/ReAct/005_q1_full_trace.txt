[INST] To translate this problem into a first-order logic format for Prover9, we can use variables for general rules and constants for specific facts.

Mapping predicates:
- "takes the bus" -> bus(x)
- "arrives on time" -> on_time(x)
- "takes a cab" -> cab(x)
- "arrives late" -> late(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
- bus(x) -> on_time(x).
- cab(x) -> late(x).

Specific Facts:
- olivia takes the bus -> bus(olivia).
- olivia won't arrive late -> -late(olivia).

Specific Premise (for olivia):
- bus(olivia) | -late(olivia).

Goal:
The goal is "on_time(olivia) | -cab(olivia)".

We can now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    bus(x) -> on_time(x).
    cab(x) -> late(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    bus(olivia) | -late(olivia).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    on_time(olivia) | -cab(olivia).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "on_time(olivia) | -cab(olivia)". This means that either olivia arrives on time or she doesn't take a cab. [end of text]
