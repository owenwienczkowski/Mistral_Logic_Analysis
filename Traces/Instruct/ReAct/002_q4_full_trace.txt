[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"diligent study" -> diligent_study(x)
"good grades" -> good_grades(x)
"excessive tv watching" -> excessive_tv_watching(x)
"hinder academic performance" -> hinders_academic_performance(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. diligent_study(x) -> good_grades(x).
2. excessive_tv_watching(x) -> hinders_academic_performance(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Tom'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Tom is committed to studying diligently" -> diligent_study(tom)
"he will excel academically" -> good_grades(tom)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. diligent_study(tom) | good_grades(tom).

Goal:
The goal is "excessive_tv_watching(tom) | hinders_academic_performance(tom)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    diligent_study(x) -> good_grades(x).
    excessive_tv_watching(x) -> hinders_academic_performance(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    diligent_study(tom) | good_grades(tom).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    excessive_tv_watching(tom) | hinders_academic_performance(tom).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "excessive_tv_watching(tom) | hinders_academic_performance(tom)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and facts. [end of text]
