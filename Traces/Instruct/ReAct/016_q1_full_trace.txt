[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"consumes processed food" -> consumes_processed_food(x)
"feels sluggish" -> feels_sluggish(x)
"eats organic food" -> eats_organic_food(x)
"has an increase in energy" -> has_increase_in_energy(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. consumes_processed_food(x) -> feels_sluggish(x).
2. eats_organic_food(x) -> has_increase_in_energy(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John consumes processed food" -> consumes_processed_food(john)
"he will not have an increase in energy" -> -has_increase_in_energy(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. consumes_processed_food(john) | -has_increase_in_energy(john).

Goal:
The goal is "feels_sluggish(john) | -eats_organic_food(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    consumes_processed_food(x) -> feels_sluggish(x).
    eats_organic_food(x) -> has_increase_in_energy(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    consumes_processed_food(john) | -has_increase_in_energy(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    feels_sluggish(john) | -eats_organic_food(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "feels_sluggish(john) | -eats_organic_food(john)". [end of text]
