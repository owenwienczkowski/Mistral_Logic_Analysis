[INST] I will translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.

Mapping predicates:
"engages in cardiovascular exercise" -> exercise(x)
"improve overall well-being" -> well_being(x)
"stays awake until late at night" -> stays_up_late(x)
"feels tired" -> feels_tired(x)
"feels healthier" -> feels_healthier(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. exercise(x) -> well_being(x).
2. stays_up_late(x) -> feels_tired(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Jack'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Jack engages in cardiovascular exercise" -> exercise(jack)
"he will feel healthier" -> feels_healthier(jack)
"he doesn't stay up late" -> -stays_up_late(jack)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. exercise(jack) | -stays_up_late(jack).

Goal:
The goal is "feels_healthier(jack) | -feels_tired(jack)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    exercise(x) -> well_being(x).
    stays_up_late(x) -> feels_tired(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    exercise(jack) | -stays_up_late(jack).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    feels_healthier(jack) | -feels_tired(jack).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "feels_healthier(jack) | -feels_tired(jack)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and axioms. [end of text]
