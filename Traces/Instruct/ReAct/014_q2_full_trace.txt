[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"neglects health" -> neglects_health(x)
"healthy" -> healthy(x)
"suffers from diseases" -> suffers_diseases(x)
"takes care of health" -> takes_care_of_health(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. neglects_health(x) -> suffers_diseases(x).
2. takes_care_of_health(x) -> healthy(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Mark'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Mark neglects his health" -> neglects_health(Mark)
"Mark will not be healthy" -> -healthy(Mark)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. neglects_health(Mark) | -healthy(Mark).

Goal:
The goal is "healthy(Mark) | -suffers_diseases(Mark)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    neglects_health(x) -> suffers_diseases(x).
    takes_care_of_health(x) -> healthy(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    neglects_health(Mark) | -healthy(Mark).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    healthy(Mark) | -suffers_diseases(Mark).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "healthy(Mark) | -suffers_diseases(Mark)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and axioms. [end of text]
