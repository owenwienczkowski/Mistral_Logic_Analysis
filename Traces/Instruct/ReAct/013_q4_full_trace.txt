[INST] To translate this problem into a first-order logic format for Prover9, we will use variables for general rules and a constant 'Ava' for the specific individual.

Mapping predicates:
- "takes the elevator" -> elevator(x)
- "arrives quickly" -> arrives_quickly(x)
- "experiences breathlessness" -> breathless(x)
- "climbs the stairs" -> climbs_stairs(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
- elevator(x) -> arrives_quickly(x).
- climbs_stairs(x) -> breathless(x).

Specific Premise (for Ava):
- elevator(Ava) | breathless(Ava).

Goal (for Ava):
The goal is "arrives_quickly(Ava) | breathless(Ava)".

We will now format the input for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    elevator(x) -> arrives_quickly(x).
    climbs_stairs(x) -> breathless(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    elevator(Ava) | breathless(Ava).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    arrives_quickly(Ava) | breathless(Ava).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that Ava arrives quickly or experiences breathlessness. [end of text]
