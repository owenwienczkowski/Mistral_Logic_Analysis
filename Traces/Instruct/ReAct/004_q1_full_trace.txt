[INST] To translate this natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9, we will use variables for general rules and a constant 'Mike' for the specific individual.

Mapping predicates:
"takes a break from work" -> takes_break(x)
"feels refreshed" -> feels_refreshed(x)
"overwhelmed" -> feels_overwhelmed(x)
"takes on more tasks" -> takes_on_more_tasks(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
takes_break(x) -> feels_refreshed(x).
takes_on_more_tasks(x) -> feels_overwhelmed(x).

Specific Premise (for Mike):
takes_break(Mike) | -feels_overwhelmed(Mike).

Goal (for Mike):
The goal is "feels_refreshed(Mike) | -takes_on_more_tasks(Mike)".

We will now format the input for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    takes_break(x) -> feels_refreshed(x).
    takes_on_more_tasks(x) -> feels_overwhelmed(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    takes_break(Mike) | -feels_overwhelmed(Mike).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    feels_refreshed(Mike) | -takes_on_more_tasks(Mike).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that Mike feels refreshed or he does not take on more tasks. [end of text]
