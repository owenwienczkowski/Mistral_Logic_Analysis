[INST] I will use variables for general rules and a constant 'julie' for the specific entity.
Mapping predicates:
attends_gym -> gym_attendance(x)
strengthens -> strength_increase(x)
gains_weight -> weight_gain(x)
eats_unhealthy -> unhealthy_food(x)
General Premises (Axioms):
gym_attendance(x) -> strength_increase(x).
unhealthy_food(x) -> weight_gain(x).

Specific Premise (for entity 'julie'):
gym_attendance(julie) | -weight_gain(julie).

Goal (for entity 'julie'):
The goal is "strength_increase(julie) | -unhealthy_food(julie)".

I will now format the input for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    gym_attendance(x) -> strength_increase(x).
    unhealthy_food(x) -> weight_gain(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    gym_attendance(julie) | -weight_gain(julie).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    strength_increase(julie) | -unhealthy_food(julie).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal of "strength_increase(julie) | -unhealthy_food(julie)" is provable. This means that Julie can achieve her goal of increasing her strength while avoiding unhealthy food. [end of text]
