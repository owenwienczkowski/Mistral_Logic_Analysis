[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"frequently uses the internet" -> uses_internet(x)
"develops a dependency on it" -> becomes_addicted(x)
"spends more time outdoors" -> engages_in_physical_activities(x)
"becomes more active" -> becomes_more_active(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. uses_internet(x) -> becomes_addicted(x).
2. engages_in_physical_activities(x) -> becomes_more_active(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Aryan'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Aryan frequently uses the internet" -> uses_internet(aryan)
"he will not become more active" -> -becomes_more_active(aryan)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. uses_internet(aryan) | -becomes_more_active(aryan).

Goal:
The goal is "doesn't become addicted to it" | goes_outdoors_more_often(aryan)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    uses_internet(x) -> becomes_addicted(x).
    engages_in_physical_activities(x) -> becomes_more_active(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    uses_internet(aryan) | -becomes_more_active(aryan).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    -becomes_addicted(aryan) | goes_outdoors_more_often(aryan).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "Aryan doesn't become addicted to it" | goes_outdoors_more_often(aryan) is not provable based on the given premises and goal. [end of text]
