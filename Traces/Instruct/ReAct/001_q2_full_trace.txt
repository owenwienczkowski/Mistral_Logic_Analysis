--- STEP 2 FAILED (Prover Error) ---
 I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"consumes ample water" -> consumes\_water(x)
"experiences a sugar crash" -> experiences\_sugar\_crash(x)
"eats too much sugar" -> eats\_too\_much\_sugar(x)
"feels hydrated" -> feels\_hydrated(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. consumes\_water(x) -> feels\_hydrated(x).
2. eats\_too\_much\_sugar(x) -> experiences\_sugar\_crash(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'jane'.
Mapping specific facts:
"jane consumes ample water" -> consumes\_water(jane)
"jane eats too much sugar" -> eats\_too\_much\_sugar(jane)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. consumes\_water(jane) | -experiences\_sugar\_crash(jane).

Goal:
The goal is "feels\_hydrated(jane) | -eats\_too\_much\_sugar(jane)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    consumes\_water(x) -> feels\_hydrated(x).
    eats\_too\_much\_sugar(x) -> experiences\_sugar\_crash(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    consumes\_water(jane) | -experiences\_sugar\_crash(jane).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    feels\_hydrated(jane) | -eats\_too\_much\_sugar(jane).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT
