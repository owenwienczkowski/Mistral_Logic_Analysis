[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"takes the bus" -> takes_bus(x)
"arrives on time" -> arrives_on_time(x)
"arrives late" -> arrives_late(x)
"takes a cab" -> takes_cab(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. takes_bus(x) -> arrives_on_time(x).
2. takes_cab(x) -> arrives_late(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'olivia'.
Mapping specific facts:
"olivia takes the bus" -> takes_bus(olivia)
"she won't arrive late" -> -arrives_late(olivia)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. takes_bus(olivia) | -arrives_late(olivia).

Goal:
The goal is "arrives_late(olivia) | -takes_bus(olivia)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    takes_bus(x) -> arrives_on_time(x).
    takes_cab(x) -> arrives_late(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    takes_bus(olivia) | -arrives_late(olivia).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    arrives_late(olivia) | -takes_bus(olivia).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "arrives_late(olivia) | -takes_bus(olivia)" is not provable based on the given premises and goal. [end of text]
