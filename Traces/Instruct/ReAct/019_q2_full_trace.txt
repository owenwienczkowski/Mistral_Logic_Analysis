[INST] To translate this problem into a first-order logic format for Prover9, we can use variables for general rules and constants for specific facts.

Mapping predicates:

* "stores in the fridge" -> fridge(x)
* "remains fresh for a longer time" -> fresh(x)
* "spoils quickly" -> spoils(x)

General Premises (Axioms):

* fridge(x) -> fresh(x)
* outside(x) -> spoils(x)

Specific Facts:

* John stores his food in the fridge: fridge(john)
* It won't spoil quickly: -spoils(john)

Specific Premise (for John):
fridge(john) | -spoils(john)

Goal:
The goal is "outside(john) | -fresh(john)"

We will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    fridge(x) -> fresh(x).
    outside(x) -> spoils(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    fridge(john) | -spoils(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    outside(john) | -fresh(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "outside(john) | -fresh(john)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and facts. [end of text]
