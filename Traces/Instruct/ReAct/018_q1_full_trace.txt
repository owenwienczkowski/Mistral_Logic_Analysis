[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"studies regularly" -> studies_regularly(x)
"learn new skills" -> learns_new_skills(x)
"stays up late" -> stays_up_late(x)
"tired" -> is_tired(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. studies_regularly(x) -> learns_new_skills(x).
2. stays_up_late(x) -> is_tired(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Amber'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Amber studies regularly" -> studies_regularly(Amber)
"she won't be tired" -> -is_tired(Amber)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. studies_regularly(Amber) | -is_tired(Amber).

Goal:
The goal is "learns_new_skills(Amber) | -stays_up_late(Amber)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    studies_regularly(x) -> learns_new_skills(x).
    stays_up_late(x) -> is_tired(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    studies_regularly(Amber) | -is_tired(Amber).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    learns_new_skills(Amber) | -stays_up_late(Amber).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "learns_new_skills(Amber) | -stays_up_late(Amber)". [end of text]
