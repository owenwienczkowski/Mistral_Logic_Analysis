[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"turn off phone" -> turns_off_phone(x)
"experience increased productivity" -> experiences_increased_productivity(x)
"distractions" -> distractions(x)
"has phone on" -> has_phone_on(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. turns_off_phone(x) -> experiences_increased_productivity(x).
2. has_phone_on(x) -> distractions(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John turns off his phone" -> turns_off_phone(john)
"he will not be distracted" -> -distractions(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. turns_off_phone(john) | -distractions(john).

Goal:
The goal is "experiences_increased_productivity(john) | has_phone_on(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    turns_off_phone(x) -> experiences_increased_productivity(x).
    has_phone_on(x) -> distractions(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    turns_off_phone(john) | -distractions(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    experiences_increased_productivity(john) | has_phone_on(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal "experiences_increased_productivity(john) | has_phone_on(john)" cannot be proven or disproven using the given premises and facts. [end of text]
