[INST] To translate this natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9, we will use variables for general rules and a constant 'Alice' for the specific entity.

Mapping predicates:
Drives recklessly -> drives\_recklessly(x)
Drives safely -> drives\_safely(x)
Receives ticket -> receives\_ticket(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
drives\_recklessly(x) -> receives\_ticket(x).
drives\_safely(x) -> safe\_journey(x).

Specific Premise (for entity 'Alice'):
drives\_recklessly(Alice) | safe\_journey(Alice).

Goal (for entity 'Alice'):
The goal is "receives\_ticket(Alice) | safe\_journey(Alice)".

We will now format the input for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    drives\_recklessly(x) -> receives\_ticket(x).
    drives\_safely(x) -> safe\_journey(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    drives\_recklessly(Alice) | safe\_journey(Alice).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    receives\_ticket(Alice) | safe\_journey(Alice).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that Alice receives a ticket or has a safe journey. [end of text]
