[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"plants trees" -> plants_trees(x)
"help the environment" -> helps_environment(x)
"pollutes the air" -> pollutes_air(x)
"contributes to global warming" -> contributes_to_global_warming(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. plants_trees(x) -> helps_environment(x).
2. pollutes_air(x) -> contributes_to_global_warming(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Aadi'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Aadi plants trees" -> plants_trees(Aadi)
"Aadi doesn't pollute the air" -> -pollutes_air(Aadi)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. plants_trees(Aadi) | -pollutes_air(Aadi).

Goal:
The goal is "helps_environment(Aadi) | -contributes_to_global_warming(Aadi)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    plants_trees(x) -> helps_environment(x).
    pollutes_air(x) -> contributes_to_global_warming(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    plants_trees(Aadi) | -pollutes_air(Aadi).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    helps_environment(Aadi) | -contributes_to_global_warming(Aadi).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal cannot be proven or disproven with the given premises and facts. [end of text]
