[INST] I will translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.

First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"spends a considerable amount of time outdoors" -> spends_outdoors(x)
"acquires a tan" -> acquires_tan(x)
"stays inside for long hours" -> stays_inside(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. spends_outdoors(x) -> acquires_tan(x).
2. stays_inside(x) -> -acquires_tan(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Rahul'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Rahul spends a considerable amount of time outdoors" -> spends_outdoors(rahul)
"he will acquire a tan" -> -stays_inside(rahul)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. spends_outdoors(rahul) | -stays_inside(rahul).

Goal:
The goal is "acquires_tan(rahul) | -stays_inside(rahul)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    spends_outdoors(x) -> acquires_tan(x).
    stays_inside(x) -> -acquires_tan(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    spends_outdoors(rahul) | -stays_inside(rahul).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    acquires_tan(rahul) | -stays_inside(rahul).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "acquires_tan(rahul) | -stays_inside(rahul)". This means that either Rahul acquires a tan or he stays inside for long hours. [end of text]
