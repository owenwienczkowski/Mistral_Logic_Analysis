[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"turns off phone" -> turns_off_phone(x)
"experience increased productivity" -> increases_productivity(x)
"distractions" -> distractions(x)
"has phone on" -> has_phone_on(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. turns_off_phone(x) -> increases_productivity(x).
2. has_phone_on(x) -> distractions(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John turns off his phone" -> turns_off_phone(john)
"he will not be distracted" -> -distractions(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. turns_off_phone(john) | -distractions(john).

Goal:
The goal is "increases_productivity(john) | -has_phone_on(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    turns_off_phone(x) -> increases_productivity(x).
    has_phone_on(x) -> distractions(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    turns_off_phone(john) | -distractions(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    increases_productivity(john) | -has_phone_on(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "increases_productivity(john) | -has_phone_on(john)". This means that either John experiences increased productivity or he does not have his phone on. [end of text]
