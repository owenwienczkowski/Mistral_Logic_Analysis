[INST] To translate this natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9, we will use variables for general rules and a constant 'Ava' for the specific individual.

Mapping predicates:
- "takes the elevator" -> takes_elevator(x)
- "arrives quickly" -> arrives_quickly(x)
- "climbs the stairs" -> climbs_stairs(x)
- "experiences breathlessness" -> experiences_breathlessness(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
- takes_elevator(x) -> arrives_quickly(x).
- climbs_stairs(x) -> experiences_breathlessness(x).

Specific Premise (for Ava):
- takes_elevator(Ava) | experiences_breathlessness(Ava).

Goal:
The goal is "arrives_quickly(Ava) | -climbs_stairs(Ava)".

We will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    takes_elevator(x) -> arrives_quickly(x).
    climbs_stairs(x) -> experiences_breathlessness(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    takes_elevator(Ava) | experiences_breathlessness(Ava).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    arrives_quickly(Ava) | -climbs_stairs(Ava).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal cannot be proven or disproven with the given premises. [end of text]
