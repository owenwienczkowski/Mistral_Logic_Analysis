[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"takes a break from work" -> takes_break(x)
"feels overwhelmed" -> feels_overwhelmed(x)
"experiences refreshed" -> experiences_refreshed(x)
"takes on more tasks" -> takes_on_more_tasks(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. takes_break(x) -> experiences_refreshed(x).
2. feels_overwhelmed(x) -> takes_on_more_tasks(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Mike'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Mike takes a break from work" -> takes_break(mike)
"he does not experience overwhelming feelings" -> -feels_overwhelmed(mike)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. takes_break(mike) | -feels_overwhelmed(mike).

Goal:
The goal is "experiences_refreshed(mike) | takes_on_more_tasks(mike)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    takes_break(x) -> experiences_refreshed(x).
    feels_overwhelmed(x) -> takes_on_more_tasks(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    takes_break(mike) | -feels_overwhelmed(mike).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    experiences_refreshed(mike) | takes_on_more_tasks(mike).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal cannot be proven or disproven with the given premises and axioms. [end of text]
