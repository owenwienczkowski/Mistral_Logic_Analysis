[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"plays video games" -> plays_video_games(x)
"has increased stress" -> has_increased_stress(x)
"meditates regularly" -> meditates_regularly(x)
"feels relaxed" -> feels_relaxed(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. plays_video_games(x) -> has_increased_stress(x).
2. meditates_regularly(x) -> feels_relaxed(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Vicky'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Vicky plays video games" -> plays_video_games(vicky)
"Vicky does not feel relaxed" -> -feels_relaxed(vicky)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. plays_video_games(vicky) | -feels_relaxed(vicky).

Goal:
The goal is "has_increased_stress(vicky) | meditates_regularly(vicky)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    plays_video_games(x) -> has_increased_stress(x).
    meditates_regularly(x) -> feels_relaxed(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    plays_video_games(vicky) | -feels_relaxed(vicky).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    has_increased_stress(vicky) | meditates_regularly(vicky).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The Prover9 tool was unable to prove the goal "has_increased_stress(vicky) | meditates_regularly(vicky)" based on the given premises and facts. This means that there is not enough information or logic to establish a definitive answer. [end of text]
