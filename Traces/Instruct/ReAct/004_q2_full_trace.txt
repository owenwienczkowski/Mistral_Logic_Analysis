--- STEP 2 FAILED (Prover Error) ---
 I will translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.

Mapping predicates:
"takes a break from work" -> takes_break(x)
"experience overwhelming feelings" -> experiences_overwhelming(x)
"won't feel refreshed" -> won't_feel_refreshed(x)
"takes on more tasks" -> takes_on_more_tasks(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. takes_break(x) -> won't_feel_refreshed(x).
2. experiences_overwhelming(x) -> takes_on_more_tasks(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Mike'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Mike takes a break from work" -> takes_break(mike)
"he won't experience overwhelming feelings" -> won't_feel_refreshed(mike)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. takes_break(mike) | won't_feel_refreshed(mike).

Goal:
The goal is "won't_feel_refreshed(mike) | takes_on_more_tasks(mike)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
