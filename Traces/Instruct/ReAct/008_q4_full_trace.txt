[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"frequently uses the internet" -> uses_internet(x)
"develops a dependency on it" -> develops_dependency(x)
"spends more time outdoors" -> spends_time_outdoors(x)
"engages in physical activities" -> engages_in_physical_activities(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. uses_internet(x) -> develops_dependency(x).
2. spends_time_outdoors(x) -> engages_in_physical_activities(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Aryan'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Aryan frequently uses the internet" -> uses_internet(aryan)
"he will not become more active" -> -engages_in_physical_activities(aryan)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. uses_internet(aryan) | -engages_in_physical_activities(aryan).

Goal:
The goal is "develops_dependency(aryan) | -spends_time_outdoors(aryan)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    uses_internet(x) -> develops_dependency(x).
    spends_time_outdoors(x) -> engages_in_physical_activities(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    uses_internet(aryan) | -engages_in_physical_activities(aryan).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    develops_dependency(aryan) | -spends_time_outdoors(aryan).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "develops_dependency(aryan) | -spends_time_outdoors(aryan)". [end of text]
