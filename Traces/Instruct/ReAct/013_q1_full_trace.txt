[INST] To translate this natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9, we will use variables for general rules and a constant 'Ava' for the individual in question.

Mapping predicates:
- "takes the elevator" -> elevator(Ava)
- "arrives quickly" -> arrives_quickly(Ava)
- "climbs the stairs" -> climbs_stairs(Ava)
- "experiences breathlessness" -> experiences_breathlessness(Ava)

General Premises (Axioms):
- elevator(Ava) -> arrives_quickly(Ava).
- climbs_stairs(Ava) -> experiences_breathlessness(Ava).

Specific Premise (for Ava):
- elevator(Ava) | -climbs_stairs(Ava).

Goal (for Ava):
The goal is "arrives_quickly(Ava) | -experiences_breathlessness(Ava)".

We will now format the input for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    elevator(x) -> arrives_quickly(x).
    climbs_stairs(x) -> experiences_breathlessness(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    elevator(Ava) | -climbs_stairs(Ava).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    arrives_quickly(Ava) | -experiences_breathlessness(Ava).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The Prover9 tool was unable to prove the goal for Ava. This means that it is not possible to determine whether Ava arrives quickly or experiences breathlessness based on the given premises. [end of text]
