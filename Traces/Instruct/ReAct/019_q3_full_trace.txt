--- STEP 2 FAILED (Prover Error) ---
 To translate this problem into a first-order logic format for Prover9, we can use variables for general rules and constants for specific facts.

Mapping predicates:
- "stores in the fridge" -> fridge(x)
- "remains fresh for a longer time" -> fresh(x)
- "spoils quickly" -> spoils(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
- fridge(x) -> fresh(x)
- outside(x) -> spoils(x)

Specific Facts:
- fridge(john)
- not spoils(john)

Specific Premise (for John):
- fridge(john) | not spoils(john)

Goal:
- fresh(john) | outside(john)

We will now format the input for the Prover9 tool.

Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    fridge(x) -> fresh(x).
    outside(x) -> spoils(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    fridge(john) | not spoils(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    fresh(john) | outside(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT
