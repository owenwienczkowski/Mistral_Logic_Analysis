[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"works long hours" -> works_long_hours(x)
"experiences refreshment" -> experiences_refreshment(x)
"becomes exhausted" -> becomes_exhausted(x)
"takes breaks" -> takes_breaks(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. works_long_hours(x) -> becomes_exhausted(x).
2. experiences_refreshment(x) -> takes_breaks(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John works long hours" -> works_long_hours(john)
"John experiences refreshment" -> experiences_refreshment(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. works_long_hours(john) | experiences_refreshment(john).

Goal:
The goal is "becomes_exhausted(john) | takes_breaks(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    works_long_hours(x) -> becomes_exhausted(x).
    experiences_refreshment(x) -> takes_breaks(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    works_long_hours(john) | experiences_refreshment(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    becomes_exhausted(john) | takes_breaks(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that "john" becomes exhausted or takes breaks. [end of text]
