[INST] I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"participates in sports" -> plays_sports(x)
"stay fit" -> stays_fit(x)
"eats unhealthy food" -> eats_unhealthy_food(x)
"negative health consequences" -> negative_health_consequences(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. plays_sports(x) -> stays_fit(x).
2. eats_unhealthy_food(x) -> negative_health_consequences(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'Dev'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Dev participates in sports" -> plays_sports(Dev)
"he won't experience negative health consequences" -> -negative_health_consequences(Dev)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. plays_sports(Dev) | -negative_health_consequences(Dev).

Goal:
The goal is "stays_fit(Dev) | eats_unhealthy_food(Dev)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
    plays_sports(x) -> stays_fit(x).
    eats_unhealthy_food(x) -> negative_health_consequences(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
    plays_sports(Dev) | -negative_health_consequences(Dev).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
    stays_fit(Dev) | eats_unhealthy_food(Dev).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER: The final answer is that the goal cannot be proven or disproven with the given premises and axioms. [end of text]
