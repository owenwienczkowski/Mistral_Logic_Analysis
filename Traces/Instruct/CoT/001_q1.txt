Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If an individual consumes a significant amount of water, they will experience a state of hydration. Conversely, if excessive amounts of sugar are ingested, a sugar crash will ensue. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either the Jane consumes ample water or she will not experience a sugar crash. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she will feel hydrated and (b) she doesn't eat too much sugar.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (consumes ample water -> hydration) and (excessive sugar intake -> sugar crash). The goal is to determine if (hydration | sugar crash) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (hydration | sugar crash) to be false, both hydration and sugar crash must be false. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if Jane consumes ample water, she will experience hydration, which satisfies the first premise (consumes ample water -> hydration). If Jane does not eat too much sugar, she will not experience a sugar crash, which satisfies the second premise (excessive sugar intake -> sugar crash). So, a counterexample exists where Jane consumes ample water and does not eat too much sugar, but still experiences a sugar crash. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
