Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If a person chooses to drive recklessly, they will receive a ticket. Conversely, if they choose to drive safely, they will reach their destination without any harm. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either the person drives recklessly, or they will not arrive at their destination safely. The true scenario could be that only the Dave drives recklessly, only that he won't arrive at their destination safely, or both situations occur together. In this specific case, it is uncertain which statement is true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will get a ticket and (b) he doesn't drive safely.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (drive recklessly -> get a ticket) and (drive safely -> arrive safely). The goal is to determine if (get a ticket | arrive safely) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (get a ticket | arrive safely) to be false, both get a ticket and arrive safely must be false. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if arrive safely is false, then drive recklessly must be true for the first premise (drive recklessly -> get a ticket) to hold. If get a ticket is false, we can assume drive safely is true to satisfy the second premise (drive safely -> arrive safely). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (drive recklessly | arrive safely), since both drive recklessly and arrive safely are false. So, a counterexample exists where the person drives recklessly, gets a ticket, but arrives safely at their destination. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
