Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Example//
Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: NO

Context: If someone puts in a significant amount of time and effort at work, they will inevitably become tired and worn out. However, by taking regular breaks, they can regain their energy and feel revitalized. We are aware that at least one of the following statements holds true: either the individual, let's call him John, works long hours or he does not experience a sense of refreshment. It is uncertain which of these statements is accurate, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, or only the second statement, or both of them simultaneously.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he won't become exhausted and (b) he doesn't take breaks.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (works long hours -> becomes exhausted) and (takes breaks -> refreshes). The goal is to determine if (won't become exhausted | doesn't take breaks) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (won't become exhausted | doesn't take breaks) to be false, either the individual works long hours and becomes exhausted or he takes breaks but doesn't refresh. Assuming the first premise, if John works long hours, he will inevitably become exhausted. If he takes breaks, he will regain his energy and feel refreshed. So, a counterexample exists where John works long hours, takes breaks, and becomes exhausted. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
