Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If an individual frequently uses the internet, they may develop a dependency on it. On the contrary, if they spend more time outdoors, they tend to engage in physical activities. It is established that at least one of the following statements is true: either Aryan spends a significant amount of time on the internet or he will not become more active. It is possible that solely (1) is true, or solely (2) is true, or even both are true simultaneously.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he doesn't become addicted to it and (b) he goes outdoors more often.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (Aryan spends a significant amount of time on the internet -> he may develop a dependency on it) and (Aryan spends more time outdoors -> he tends to engage in physical activities). The goal is to determine if (a) he doesn't become addicted to it and (b) he goes outdoors more often must always be true.

To prove this, we can use the contrapositive of the first premise: (Aryan doesn't become addicted to it -> he doesn't spend a significant amount of time on the internet). From this, we can conclude that if Aryan doesn't become addicted to it, then he will not become more active. Similarly, we can use the contrapositive of the second premise: (Aryan goes outdoors more often -> he doesn't spend more time on the internet). From this, we can conclude that if Aryan goes outdoors more often, then he will not become more active.

Since both conclusions hold in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed that at least one of the following must always be true: (a) he doesn't become addicted to it and (b) he goes outdoors more often.
