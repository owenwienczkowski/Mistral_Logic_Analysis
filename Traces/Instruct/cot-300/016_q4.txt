Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If someone consumes food that has gone through processing, they may experience a decrease in their energy levels. Conversely, if they choose to consume food that is organic, they might feel more energized. It is important to note that we are aware of the truth of at least one of the following statements: (1) an individual named John consumes processed food, and (2) he will not have an increase in energy. The specific case in question does not reveal whether only (1) is true, only (2) is true, or if both statements hold true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he won't feel sluggish. and (b) he doesn't eat organic food..
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (processed food -> sluggishness) and (organic food -> energy increase). The goal is to determine if (won't feel sluggish | doesn't eat organic food) must be true.

If John consumes processed food, then he will experience sluggishness, which means he won't feel sluggish. Therefore, the conclusion (won't feel sluggish | doesn't eat organic food) is true.

If John consumes organic food, then he will feel more energized, which means he won't feel sluggish. Therefore, the conclusion (won't feel sluggish | doesn't eat organic food) is true.

Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
