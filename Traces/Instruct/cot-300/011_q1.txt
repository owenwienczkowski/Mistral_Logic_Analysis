Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: NO

Context: If someone plays video games, then they have increased stress. if they meditate regularly, then they will feel relaxed. It is known that at least one of the following is true: either Vicky plays video games or he do not feel relaxed. The exact combination of these possibilities is unknown.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he has increased stress and (b) he doesn't meditate regularly.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (Vicky plays video games -> increased stress) and (Vicky meditates regularly -> relaxed). The goal is to determine if (increased stress | not meditates regularly) must be true.

If Vicky plays video games, then he has increased stress, which means that the conclusion (increased stress | not meditates regularly) is true.

If Vicky does not meditate regularly, then he does not feel relaxed, which means that the conclusion (increased stress | not meditates regularly) is true.

Since both premises lead to the same conclusion, it is logically guaranteed that at least one of the following must always be true: (a) he has increased stress and (b) he doesn't meditate regularly.
