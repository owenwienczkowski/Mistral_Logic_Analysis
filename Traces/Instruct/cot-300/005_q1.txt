Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If someone takes the bus, then they will arrive on time. if they take a cab, then they will arrive late. we know that atleast one of the following is true (1) olivia takes the bus. and (2) she won't arrive late.. note that we do not know which ones of (1) and (2) are true. it might be the case that only (1) is true, or only (2) is true or both are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she will arrive on time. and (b) she doesn't take a cab..
Let's think step by step.
Thought: [/INST] The premises are (bus -> on time) and (cab -> late). The goal is to determine if (on time | not cab) must be true. We can use the contrapositive of the second premise to check if (late | cab) is true. If (late | cab) is true, then (cab | not on time) is true, which means that if someone takes a cab, they will not arrive on time. However, we don't know if (cab | not on time) is true or not. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that at least one of the following must always be true.
