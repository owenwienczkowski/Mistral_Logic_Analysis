Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If a person attends regular gym sessions, they will experience an increase in their physical strength. Consuming unhealthy food regularly will lead to an individual gaining weight. At least one of the following scenarios is true: either Julie is dedicated to her gym routine or she will not experience weight gain. It is unclear which statement from the above is accurate, as either one or both of them could hold true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she won't become stronger and (b) she doesn't eat unhealthy food.
Let's think step by step.
Thought:  The premises are (gym -> stronger), (unhealthy food -> weight gain), and (gym | weight gain). The goal is to prove (not stronger | not unhealthy food). I can use the premise (gym | weight gain) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'gym' is true, then 'not stronger' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (not stronger | not unhealthy food) true. In the second case, if 'weight gain' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (weight gain -> not unhealthy food). From this, 'weight gain' being true means 'not unhealthy food' is true, which also makes the conclusion (not stronger | not unhealthy food) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
