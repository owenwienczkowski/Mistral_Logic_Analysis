Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If someone puts in a significant amount of time and effort at work, they will inevitably become tired and worn out. However, by taking regular breaks, they can regain their energy and feel revitalized. We are aware that at least one of the following statements holds true: either the individual, let's call him John, works long hours or he does not experience a sense of refreshment. It is uncertain which of these statements is accurate, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, or only the second statement, or both of them simultaneously.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will become exhausted and (b) he doesn't take breaks.
Let's think step by step.
Thought:  The premises are (work long hours -> become exhausted), (take breaks -> feel refreshed), and (work long hours | feel refreshed). The goal is to prove (become exhausted | -take breaks). I can use the premise (work long hours | feel refreshed) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'work long hours' is true, then 'become exhausted' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (become exhausted | -take breaks) true. In the second case, if 'feel refreshed' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (feel refreshed -> -take breaks). From this, 'feel refreshed' being true means '-take breaks' is true, which also makes the conclusion (become exhausted | -take breaks) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If someone is a skilled and experienced programmer, they will be able to write efficient and bug-free code. However, if they are not familiar with the latest programming languages and frameworks, they may struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving industry. We know that at least one of the following statements is true: either the individual, let's call him John, is a skilled and experienced programmer or he is not familiar with the latest programming languages and frameworks. It is uncertain which of these statements is accurate, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, or only the second statement, or both of them simultaneously.

Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (skilled and experienced -> efficient and bug-free), (not familiar with latest -> struggle to keep up), and (skilled and experienced | not familiar with latest).

In the first case, if 'skilled and experienced' is true, then 'efficient and bug-free' must
