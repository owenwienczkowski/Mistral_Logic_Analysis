Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If someone is frequently outside, it is likely that they will develop a tan. Conversely, if an individual spends prolonged periods indoors, it is unlikely for them to get a tan. At least one of the following statements holds true: (1) Rahul spends a considerable amount of time outdoors or (2) he will acquire a tan. It is important to note that we do not possess knowledge regarding the accuracy of (1) or (2). It could be the case that only (1) is accurate, or solely (2), or possibly, both are accurate. (Rephrased: It is uncertain if spending time outdoors or acquiring a tan is true, or if both are true.)
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he won't get a tan and (b) he doesn't stay inside for long hours.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: 1. The premises are (frequently outside -> likely tan), (prolonged indoors -> unlikely tan), and (frequently outside | tan). The goal is to prove (won't get tan | -stay indoors for long hours). I can use the premise (frequently outside | tan) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'frequently outside' is true, then 'won't get a tan' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (won't get tan | -stay indoors for long hours) true. In the second case, if 'tan' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (tan -> -prolonged indoors). From this, 'tan' being true means '-prolonged indoors' is true, which also makes the conclusion (won't get tan | -stay indoors for long hours) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

In the first case, if 'frequently outside' is true, then 'won't get a tan' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (won't get tan | -stay indoors for long hours) true.
