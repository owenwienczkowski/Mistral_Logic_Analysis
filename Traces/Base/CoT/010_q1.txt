Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: NO

Context: If someone plants trees, then they will help the environment. if they pollute the air, then they will contribute to global warming. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either Aadi is actively involved in planting trees or he is committed to not contributing to global warming. The specifics of which statement is true are unknown, as it could be either one or both.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will help the environment and (b) he doesn't pollute the air.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: 1. The premises are (plant trees -> help environment), (pollute air -> global warming), and (plant trees | not contribute global warming). The goal is to prove (help environment | -pollute air). I can use the premise (plant trees | not contribute global warming) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'plant trees' is true, then 'help environment' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (help environment | -pollute air) true. In the second case, if 'not contribute global warming' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (global warming -> pollute air). From this, 'not contribute global warming' being true means '-pollute air' is true, which also makes the conclusion (help environment | -pollute air) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
