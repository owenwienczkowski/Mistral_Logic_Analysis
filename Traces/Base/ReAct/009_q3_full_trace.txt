
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"turn off phone" -> turns_off_phone(x)
"experience increased productivity" -> experiences_increased_productivity(x)
"leave phone on" -> leaves_phone_on(x)
"experience distractions" -> experiences_distractions(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. turns_off_phone(x) -> experiences_increased_productivity(x).
2. leaves_phone_on(x) -> experiences_distractions(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John turns off his phone" -> turns_off_phone(john)
"he will not be distracted" -> -experiences_distractions(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. turns_off_phone(john) | -experiences_distractions(john).

Goal:
The goal is "experiences_increased_productivity(john) | leaves_phone_on(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  turns_off_phone(x) -> experiences_increased_productivity(x).
  leaves_phone_on(x) -> experiences_distractions(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  turns_off_phone(john) | -experiences_distractions(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  experiences_increased_productivity(john) | leaves_phone_on(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
