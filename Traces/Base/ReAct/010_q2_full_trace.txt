
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"plants trees" -> plants_trees(x)
"help the environment" -> helps_environment(x)
"pollute the air" -> pollutes_air(x)
"contribute to global warming" -> contributes_to_global_warming(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. plants_trees(x) -> helps_environment(x).
2. pollutes_air(x) -> contributes_to_global_warming(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'aadi'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Aadi is actively involved in planting trees" -> plants_trees(aadi)
"he is committed to not contributing to global warming" -> -contributes_to_global_warming(aadi)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. plants_trees(aadi) | -contributes_to_global_warming(aadi).

Goal:
The goal is "-helps_environment(aadi) | -pollutes_air(aadi)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  plants_trees(x) -> helps_environment(x).
  pollutes_air(x) -> contributes_to_global_warming(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  plants_trees(aadi) | -contributes_to_global_warming(aadi).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  -helps_environment(aadi) | -pollutes_air(aadi).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
Therefore, the answer is "NO".
