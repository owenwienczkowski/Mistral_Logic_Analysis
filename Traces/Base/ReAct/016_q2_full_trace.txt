
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"consumes processed food" -> consumes_processed_food(x)
"experience a decrease in energy levels" -> experiences_decrease_energy_levels(x)
"choose to consume food that is organic" -> chooses_to_consume_organic_food(x)
"feel more energized" -> feels_more_energized(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. consumes_processed_food(x) -> experiences_decrease_energy_levels(x).
2. chooses_to_consume_organic_food(x) -> feels_more_energized(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John consumes processed food" -> consumes_processed_food(john)
"he will not have an increase in energy" -> -feels_more_energized(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. consumes_processed_food(john) | -feels_more_energized(john).

Goal:
The goal is "feels_more_energized(john) | chooses_to_consume_organic_food(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  consumes_processed_food(x) -> experiences_decrease_energy_levels(x).
  chooses_to_consume_organic_food(x) -> feels_more_energized(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  consumes_processed_food(john) | -feels_more_energized(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  feels_more_energized(john) | chooses_to_consume_organic_food(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
