
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"spends a considerable amount of time outdoors" -> spends_time_outdoors(x)
"develops a tan" -> develops_tan(x)
"spends prolonged periods indoors" -> spends_time_indoors(x)
"gets a tan" -> gets_tan(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. spends_time_outdoors(x) -> develops_tan(x).
2. spends_time_indoors(x) -> -gets_tan(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'rahul'.
Mapping specific facts:
"rahul spends a considerable amount of time outdoors" -> spends_time_outdoors(rahul)
"he will acquire a tan" -> gets_tan(rahul)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. spends_time_outdoors(rahul) | gets_tan(rahul).

Goal:
The goal is "gets_tan(rahul) | -spends_time_indoors(rahul)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  spends_time_outdoors(x) -> develops_tan(x).
  spends_time_indoors(x) -> -gets_tan(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  spends_time_outdoors(rahul) | gets_tan(rahul).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  gets_tan(rahul) | -spends_time_indoors(rahul).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The answer is "NO".
