
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"engages in cardiovascular exercise" -> cardio_exercise(x)
"improve overall well-being" -> improves_well_being(x)
"stay awake until late at night" -> stays_up_late(x)
"feel tired" -> feels_tired(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. cardio_exercise(x) -> improves_well_being(x).
2. stays_up_late(x) -> feels_tired(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'jack'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Jack goes for a run" -> cardio_exercise(jack)
"he will feel tired" -> feels_tired(jack)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. cardio_exercise(jack) | feels_tired(jack).

Goal:
The goal is "improves_well_being(jack) | -stays_up_late(jack)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  cardio_exercise(x) -> improves_well_being(x).
  stays_up_late(x) -> feels_tired(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  cardio_exercise(jack) | feels_tired(jack).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  improves_well_being(jack) | -stays_up_late(jack).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
