
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"puts in a significant amount of time and effort at work" -> works_long_hours(x)
"become tired and worn out" -> becomes_exhausted(x)
"regain energy and feel revitalized" -> regains_energy(x)
"takes regular breaks" -> takes_breaks(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. works_long_hours(x) -> becomes_exhausted(x).
2. takes_breaks(x) -> regains_energy(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John works long hours" -> works_long_hours(john)
"he won't become exhausted" -> -becomes_exhausted(john)
"he takes breaks" -> takes_breaks(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. works_long_hours(john) | -takes_breaks(john).

Goal:
The goal is "-becomes_exhausted(john) | -regains_energy(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  works_long_hours(x) -> becomes_exhausted(x).
  takes_breaks(x) -> regains_energy(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  works_long_hours(john) | -takes_breaks(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  -becomes_exhausted(john) | -regains_energy(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
