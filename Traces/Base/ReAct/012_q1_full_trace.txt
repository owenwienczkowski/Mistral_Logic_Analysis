
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"puts in a significant amount of time and effort at work" -> works_long_hours(x)
"will become exhausted" -> becomes_exhausted(x)
"takes regular breaks" -> takes_breaks(x)
"feels revitalized" -> feels_revitalized(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. works_long_hours(x) -> becomes_exhausted(x).
2. takes_breaks(x) -> feels_revitalized(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John works long hours" -> works_long_hours(john)
"he will become exhausted" -> becomes_exhausted(john)
"he doesn't take breaks" -> -takes_breaks(john)
"he doesn't feel revitalized" -> -feels_revitalized(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. works_long_hours(john) | -feels_revitalized(john).

Goal:
The goal is "becomes_exhausted(john) | -takes_breaks(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  works_long_hours(x) -> becomes_exhausted(x).
  takes_breaks(x) -> feels_revitalized(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  works_long_hours(john) | -feels_revitalized(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  becomes_exhausted(john) | -takes_breaks(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The final answer is "becomes_exhausted(john) | -takes_breaks(john)".
