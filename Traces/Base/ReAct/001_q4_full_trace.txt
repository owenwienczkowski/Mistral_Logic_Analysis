
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"consumes a significant amount of water" -> consumes_water(x)
"experience a state of hydration" -> experiences_hydration(x)
"ingests excessive amounts of sugar" -> ingests_sugar(x)
"ensue a sugar crash" -> ensues_sugar_crash(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. consumes_water(x) -> experiences_hydration(x).
2. ingests_sugar(x) -> ensues_sugar_crash(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'jane'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Jane consumes a significant amount of water" -> consumes_water(jane)
"she won't feel hydrated" -> -experiences_hydration(jane)
"she doesn't eat too much sugar" -> -ingests_sugar(jane)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. consumes_water(jane) | -ingests_sugar(jane).

Goal:
The goal is "-experiences_hydration(jane) | -ensues_sugar_crash(jane)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  consumes_water(x) -> experiences_hydration(x).
  ingests_sugar(x) -> ensues_sugar_crash(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  consumes_water(jane) | -ingests_sugar(jane).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  -experiences_hydration(jane) | -ensues_sugar_crash(jane).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The answer is NO.
