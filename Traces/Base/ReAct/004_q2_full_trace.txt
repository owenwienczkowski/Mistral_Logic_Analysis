
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"take a break from work" -> takes_break(x)
"feel overwhelmed" -> feels_overwhelmed(x)
"feel refreshed" -> feels_refreshed(x)
"take on more tasks" -> takes_on_more_tasks(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. takes_break(x) -> feels_refreshed(x).
2. takes_on_more_tasks(x) -> feels_overwhelmed(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'mike'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Mike takes a break from work" -> takes_break(mike)
"he do not experience overwhelming feelings" -> -feels_overwhelmed(mike)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. takes_break(mike) | -feels_overwhelmed(mike).

Goal:
The goal is "feels_refreshed(mike) | takes_on_more_tasks(mike)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  takes_break(x) -> feels_refreshed(x).
  takes_on_more_tasks(x) -> feels_overwhelmed(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  takes_break(mike) | -feels_overwhelmed(mike).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  feels_refreshed(mike) | takes_on_more_tasks(mike).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
