
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"studies regularly" -> studies_regularly(x)
"learn new skills" -> learns_new_skills(x)
"stay up late" -> stays_up_late(x)
"be tired" -> is_tired(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. studies_regularly(x) -> learns_new_skills(x).
2. stays_up_late(x) -> is_tired(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'amber'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Amber studies regularly" -> studies_regularly(amber)
"she won't be tired" -> -is_tired(amber)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. studies_regularly(amber) | -is_tired(amber).

Goal:
The goal is "learns_new_skills(amber) | -stays_up_late(amber)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  studies_regularly(x) -> learns_new_skills(x).
  stays_up_late(x) -> is_tired(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  studies_regularly(amber) | -is_tired(amber).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  learns_new_skills(amber) | -stays_up_late(amber).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER: TRUE
