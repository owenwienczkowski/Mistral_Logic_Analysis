
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"neglects his health" -> neglects_health(x)
"will suffer from diseases" -> suffers_diseases(x)
"takes care of his health" -> takes_care_health(x)
"will not be healthy" -> not_healthy(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. neglects_health(x) -> suffers_diseases(x).
2. takes_care_health(x) -> not_healthy(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'mark'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Mark neglects his health" -> neglects_health(mark)
"he will not be healthy" -> not_healthy(mark)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. neglects_health(mark) | not_healthy(mark).

Goal:
The goal is "suffers_diseases(mark) | takes_care_health(mark)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  neglects_health(x) -> suffers_diseases(x).
  takes_care_health(x) -> not_healthy(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  neglects_health(mark) | not_healthy(mark).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  suffers_diseases(mark) | takes_care_health(mark).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
Therefore, the answer is "suffers_diseases(mark) | takes_care_health(mark)".
