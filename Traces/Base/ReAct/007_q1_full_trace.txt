
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"chooses to drive recklessly" -> drives_recklessly(x)
"receive a ticket" -> receives_ticket(x)
"chooses to drive safely" -> drives_safely(x)
"will not arrive at their destination safely" -> does_not_arrive_safely(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. drives_recklessly(x) -> receives_ticket(x).
2. drives_safely(x) -> does_not_arrive_safely(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'dave'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Dave chooses to drive recklessly" -> drives_recklessly(dave)
"he will not arrive at their destination safely" -> does_not_arrive_safely(dave)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. drives_recklessly(dave) | does_not_arrive_safely(dave).

Goal:
The goal is "receives_ticket(dave) | does_not_arrive_safely(dave)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  drives_recklessly(x) -> receives_ticket(x).
  drives_safely(x) -> does_not_arrive_safely(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  drives_recklessly(dave) | does_not_arrive_safely(dave).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  receives_ticket(dave) | does_not_arrive_safely(dave).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover proved that Dave will receive a ticket or will not arrive at their destination safely.
