
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"participates in sports" -> plays_sports(x)
"stay fit" -> stays_fit(x)
"eat unhealthy food" -> eats_unhealthy_food(x)
"become unhealthy" -> becomes_unhealthy(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. plays_sports(x) -> stays_fit(x).
2. eats_unhealthy_food(x) -> becomes_unhealthy(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'dev'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Dev participates in sports" -> plays_sports(dev)
"he won't experience negative health consequences" -> -becomes_unhealthy(dev)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. plays_sports(dev) | -becomes_unhealthy(dev).

Goal:
The goal is "stays_fit(dev) | -eats_unhealthy_food(dev)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  plays_sports(x) -> stays_fit(x).
  eats_unhealthy_food(x) -> becomes_unhealthy(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  plays_sports(dev) | -becomes_unhealthy(dev).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  stays_fit(dev) | -eats_unhealthy_food(dev).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The final answer is "stays_fit(dev) | -eats_unhealthy_food(dev)".

I will now translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"participates in sports" -> plays_sports(x)
"stay fit" -> stays_fit(x)
"eat unhealthy food"
