
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"operates a vehicle in a reckless manner" -> reckless_driving(x)
"receive a ticket" -> receives_ticket(x)
"drives safely" -> drives_safely(x)
"have a journey that is free from harm" -> has_safe_journey(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. reckless_driving(x) -> receives_ticket(x).
2. drives_safely(x) -> has_safe_journey(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'alice'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Alice drives recklessly" -> reckless_driving(alice)
"she will not experience a safe journey" -> -has_safe_journey(alice)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. reckless_driving(alice) | -has_safe_journey(alice).

Goal:
The goal is "receives_ticket(alice) | drives_safely(alice)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  reckless_driving(x) -> receives_ticket(x).
  drives_safely(x) -> has_safe_journey(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  reckless_driving(alice) | -has_safe_journey(alice).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  receives_ticket(alice) | drives_safely(alice).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
