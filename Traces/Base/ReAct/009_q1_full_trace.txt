
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"chooses to turn off their phone" -> turns_off_phone(x)
"experience increased productivity" -> is_productive(x)
"leaving the phone on may lead to distractions" -> gets_distracted(x)
"at least one of the following statements is true" -> at_least_one(x)
"John has turned off his phone" -> turns_off_phone(john)
"he will not be distracted" -> -gets_distracted(john)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. turns_off_phone(x) -> is_productive(x).
2. gets_distracted(x) -> -is_productive(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"John chooses to turn off his phone" -> turns_off_phone(john)
"he will not be distracted" -> -gets_distracted(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. at_least_one(john).

Goal:
The goal is "is_productive(john) | -gets_distracted(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  turns_off_phone(x) -> is_productive(x).
  gets_distracted(x) -> -is_productive(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  at_least_one(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  is_productive(john) | -gets_distracted(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: FAILED
Thought: The prover result was FAILED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The prover result was FAILED.
