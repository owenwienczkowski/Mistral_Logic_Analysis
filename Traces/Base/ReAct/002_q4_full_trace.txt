
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"dedicates themselves to studying diligently" -> diligently_studies(x)
"achieve commendable grades" -> gets_good_grades(x)
"spending excessive amounts of time watching television" -> watches_too_much_tv(x)
"hinder their performance in school" -> hinders_performance(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. diligently_studies(x) -> gets_good_grades(x).
2. watches_too_much_tv(x) -> hinders_performance(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'tom'.
Mapping specific facts:
"Tom is committed to studying diligently" -> diligently_studies(tom)
"he will excel academically" -> gets_good_grades(tom)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. diligently_studies(tom) | gets_good_grades(tom).

Goal:
The goal is "gets_good_grades(tom) | -watches_too_much_tv(tom)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  diligently_studies(x) -> gets_good_grades(x).
  watches_too_much_tv(x) -> hinders_performance(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  diligently_studies(tom) | gets_good_grades(tom).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  gets_good_grades(tom) | -watches_too_much_tv(tom).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The final answer is "gets_good_grades(tom) | -watches_too_much_tv(tom)".
