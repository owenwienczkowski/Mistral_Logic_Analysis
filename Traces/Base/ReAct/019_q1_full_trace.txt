
I need to translate the natural language problem into formal logic for Prover9.
First, I will define the general rules with variables.
Mapping predicates:
"stores food in the fridge" -> stores_food_in_fridge(x)
"remain fresh for a longer time" -> remains_fresh_for_longer_time(x)
"spoil quickly" -> spoils_quickly(x)
"keep food outside" -> keeps_food_outside(x)

General Premises (Axioms):
1. stores_food_in_fridge(x) -> remains_fresh_for_longer_time(x).
2. keeps_food_outside(x) -> spoils_quickly(x).

Now, I will formalize the specific facts about 'john'.
Mapping specific facts:
"john stores his food in the fridge" -> stores_food_in_fridge(john)
"it won't spoil quickly" -> -spoils_quickly(john)

Specific Premise (for this problem):
3. stores_food_in_fridge(john) | -spoils_quickly(john).

Goal:
The goal is "remains_fresh_for_longer_time(john) | -keeps_food_outside(john)".

I will now format these premises and the goal for the Prover9 tool.
Action:
BEGIN_PROVER9_INPUT
formulas(usable).
  stores_food_in_fridge(x) -> remains_fresh_for_longer_time(x).
  keeps_food_outside(x) -> spoils_quickly(x).
end_of_list.
formulas(sos).
  stores_food_in_fridge(john) | -spoils_quickly(john).
end_of_list.
formulas(goals).
  remains_fresh_for_longer_time(john) | -keeps_food_outside(john).
end_of_list.
END_PROVER9_INPUT

END_PROVER9_INPUT
Observation: PROVED
Thought: The prover result was PROVED.
FINAL ANSWER:
The final answer is "john keeps his food outside".
