Context: If somebody operates a vehicle in a reckless manner, they will receive a ticket. Conversely, if they drive safely, they will have a journey that is free from harm. We are aware that at least one of the following statements is true: either (1) Alice drives recklessly, or (2) Alice will not experience a safe journey. Note that we are uncertain about which of these statements, (1) or (2), is accurate. It is plausible that only (1) is true, or only (2) is true, or even that both could be true.

Rephrased sentence: Either Alice engages in reckless driving or she will not have a journey that is safe.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she won't get a ticket and (b) she doesn't drive safely.
Respond only either "Yes" or "No".
FINAL ANSWER: No

Explanation:

The sentence is ambiguous. It could mean either of the following:

(1) Either Alice drives recklessly or she will not experience a safe journey.
(2) Either Alice will not get a ticket or she will not drive safely.

In (1), the sentence is true. If Alice drives recklessly, she will not experience a safe journey. If she does not drive recklessly, she will experience a safe journey.

In (2), the sentence is false. If Alice does not get a ticket, she could still drive recklessly. If she does not drive recklessly, she could still get a ticket.

The question asks whether (2) is always true. The answer is no.
