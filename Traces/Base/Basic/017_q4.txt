Context: If someone is frequently outside, it is likely that they will develop a tan. Conversely, if an individual spends prolonged periods indoors, it is unlikely for them to get a tan. At least one of the following statements holds true: (1) Rahul spends a considerable amount of time outdoors or (2) he will acquire a tan. It is important to note that we do not possess knowledge regarding the accuracy of (1) or (2). It could be the case that only (1) is accurate, or solely (2), or possibly, both are accurate. (Rephrased: It is uncertain if spending time outdoors or acquiring a tan is true, or if both are true.)
