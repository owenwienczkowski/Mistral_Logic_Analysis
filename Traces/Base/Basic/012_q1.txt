Context: If someone puts in a significant amount of time and effort at work, they will inevitably become tired and worn out. However, by taking regular breaks, they can regain their energy and feel revitalized. We are aware that at least one of the following statements holds true: either the individual, let's call him John, works long hours or he does not experience a sense of refreshment. It is uncertain which of these statements is accurate, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, or only the second statement, or both of them simultaneously.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will become exhausted and (b) he doesn't take breaks.
Respond only either "Yes" or "No".
FINAL ANSWER:

Yes, at least one of the following must always be true.

Explanation:

The statement "at least one of the following must always be true" is a conditional statement that is equivalent to the statement "if at least one of the following is true, then at least one of the following must always be true." In order to determine whether this statement is true or false, we must first identify the two statements that are being conditioned on. In this case, the two statements are "he will become exhausted" and "he doesn't take breaks."

To determine whether the conditional statement is true or false, we must consider all possible scenarios in which the two statements could be true or false. There are four possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: Both statements are true. In this scenario, the conditional statement is true because if both statements are true, then at least one of them must always be true.

Scenario 2: Both statements are false. In this scenario, the conditional statement is also true because if both statements are false, then at least one of them must always be true.

Scenario 3: The first statement is true and the second statement is false. In this scenario, the conditional statement is true because if the first statement is true and the second statement is false, then at least one of them must always be true.

Scenario 4: The
