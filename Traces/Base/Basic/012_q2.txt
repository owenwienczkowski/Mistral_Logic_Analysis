Context: If someone puts in a significant amount of time and effort at work, they will inevitably become tired and worn out. However, by taking regular breaks, they can regain their energy and feel revitalized. We are aware that at least one of the following statements holds true: either the individual, let's call him John, works long hours or he does not experience a sense of refreshment.
