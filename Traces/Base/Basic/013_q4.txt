Context: If an individual chooses to ride the elevator, they will reach their destination more quickly, whereas if they opt to climb the stairs, they will find themselves short of breath. Interestingly, we can infer that at least one of two situations is true: either Ava takes the elevator or she will not experience any breathlessness. Importantly, it remains ambiguous whether only one of these situations is true, or if both are indeed accurate.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she won't arrive quickly and (b) she doesn't climb the stairs.
Respond only either "Yes" or "No".
FINAL ANSWER:

Yes

No

Explanation:

The answer is "Yes".

The statement "At least one of the following must always be true" means that at least one of the following statements must be true for all possible situations.

In this case, the two statements are "she won't arrive quickly" and "she doesn't climb the stairs".

Since it is given that if she chooses to ride the elevator, she will reach her destination more quickly, and if she chooses to climb the stairs, she will find herself short of breath, it is clear that at least one of these two statements must be true for all possible situations.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Can we say at least one of the following must always be true?" is "Yes".
