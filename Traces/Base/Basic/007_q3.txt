Context: If a person chooses to drive recklessly, they will receive a ticket. Conversely, if they choose to drive safely, they will reach their destination without any harm. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either the person drives recklessly, or they will not arrive at their destination safely. The true scenario could be that only the Dave drives recklessly, only that he won't arrive at their destination safely, or both situations occur together. In this specific case, it is uncertain which statement is true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will get a ticket and (b) he drives safely.
Respond only either "Yes" or "No".
FINAL ANSWER:

Yes, at least one of the following must always be true.

Explanation:

The statement "at least one of the following must always be true" is a conditional statement. It means that if one of the following statements is true, then the other must also be true. In this case, the two statements are "he will get a ticket" and "he drives safely".

To determine if at least one of the following must always be true, we must first consider the two statements separately.

Statement 1: "he will get a ticket"

This statement is true if the person drives recklessly. If the person drives recklessly, then they will receive a ticket. Therefore, this statement is true if the person drives recklessly.

Statement 2: "he drives safely"

This statement is true if the person drives safely. If the person drives safely, then they will not receive a ticket. Therefore, this statement is true if the person drives safely.

Now, let's consider the two statements together. If the person drives recklessly, then both statements are true. If the person drives safely, then both statements are false. Therefore, at least one of the following must always be true.

In conclusion, the answer to the question "Can we say at least one of the following must always be true?" is "Yes". [end of text]
