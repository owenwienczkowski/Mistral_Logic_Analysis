Context: If somebody operates a vehicle in a reckless manner, they will receive a ticket. Conversely, if they drive safely, they will have a journey that is free from harm. We are aware that at least one of the following statements is true: either (1) Alice drives recklessly, or (2) Alice will not experience a safe journey. Note that we are uncertain about which of these statements, (1) or (2), is accurate. It is plausible that only (1) is true, or only (2) is true, or even that both could be true.

Rephrased sentence: Either Alice engages in reckless driving or she will not have a journey that is safe.
