Context: If an individual consumes a significant amount of water, they will experience a state of hydration. Conversely, if excessive amounts of sugar are ingested, a sugar crash will ensue. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either the Jane consumes ample water or she will not experience a sugar crash.
