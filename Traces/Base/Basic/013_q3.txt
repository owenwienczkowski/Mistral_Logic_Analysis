Context: If an individual chooses to ride the elevator, they will reach their destination more quickly, whereas if they opt to climb the stairs, they will find themselves short of breath. Interestingly, we can infer that at least one of two situations is true: either Ava takes the elevator or she will not experience any breathlessness. Importantly, it remains ambiguous whether only one of these situations is true, or if both are indeed accurate.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she will arrive quickly and (b) she climbs the stairs.
Respond only either "Yes" or "No".
FINAL ANSWER:

Yes
