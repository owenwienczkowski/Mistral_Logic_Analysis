Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If a person chooses to turn off their phone, they are likely to experience increased productivity. Conversely, leaving the phone on may lead to distractions. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John has turned off his phone, or he will not be distracted. The accuracy of these statements is unknown, as it could be the case that only one of them is true, or both could be accurate.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he won't be more productive and (b) he keeps his phone on.
Let's think step by step.
Thought:  The premises are (turn off phone -> increased productivity), (phone on -> distractions), and (turn off phone | -distractions). The goal is to determine if (-increased productivity | phone on) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-increased productivity | phone on) to be false, both increased productivity and phone on must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if phone on is true, then distractions must be true for the second premise (phone on -> distractions) to hold. If increased productivity is true, we can assume turn off phone is true to satisfy the first premise (turn off phone -> increased productivity). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (turn off phone | -distractions), since both turn off phone and -distractions are true. So, a counterexample exists where turn off phone is true, increased productivity is true, phone on is true, and distractions are true. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
