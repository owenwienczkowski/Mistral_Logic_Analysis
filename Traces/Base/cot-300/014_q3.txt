Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: NO

Context: If someone does not prioritize their well-being, they will likely experience health issues. Conversely, if they pay attention to their health, they will likely remain in good health. It is uncertain which of the following statements is true: (1) Mark neglects his health, or (2) he will not be healthy. It is possible that either only (1) is true, only (2) is true, or both are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will suffer from diseases and (b) he takes care of his health.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: 1. The premises are (not prioritize well-being -> health issues), (pay attention to health -> good health), and (not prioritize well-being | good health). The goal is to determine if (suffer from diseases | take care of health) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (suffer from diseases | take care of health) to be false, both 'suffer from diseases' and 'take care of health' must be false. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if 'take care of health' is false, then 'pay attention to health' must be false for the second premise (pay attention to health -> good health) to hold. If 'suffer from diseases' is false, we can assume 'not prioritize well-being' is false to satisfy the first premise (not prioritize well-being -> health issues). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (not prioritize well-being | good health), since both 'not prioritize well-being' and 'good health' are false. So, a counterexample exists where 'not prioritize well-being' is false, 'pay attention to health' is false, 'suffer from diseases' is false, and 'take care of health' is false. Since all premises can be false while the conclusion is false,
