Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If an individual decides to take a temporary break from their professional responsibilities, it can contribute to their overall sense of rejuvenation. However, if they choose to burden themselves with additional tasks, they may find themselves feeling overwhelmed. In this scenario, we are aware that at least one of the following statements holds true: (1) Mike takes a break from work, or (2) he do not experience overwhelming feelings. It is important to note that we lack knowledge regarding which one, or both, of these statements are accurate.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he won't feel refreshed and (b) he takes on more tasks.
Let's think step by step.
Thought: 1. The premises are (take a break -> rejuvenation), (burden -> overwhelmed), and (take a break | overwhelmed). The goal is to prove (won't feel refreshed | take on more tasks). I can use the premise (take a break | overwhelmed) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'take a break' is true, then 'won't feel refreshed' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (won't feel refreshed | take on more tasks) true. In the second case, if 'overwhelmed' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (overwhelmed -> burden). From this, 'overwhelmed' being true means 'burden' is true, which also makes the conclusion (won't feel refreshed | take on more tasks) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
