Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If someone engages in cardiovascular exercise, their overall well-being may improve. However, if an individual stays awake until late at night, they are likely to experience feelings of exhaustion the following day. One thing we can ascertain is that either the Jack goes for a run and doesn't feel tired, or he don't go for a run and feel tired. The exact situation remains unknown.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) he will feel healthier and (b) he doesn't stay up late.
Let's think step by step.
Thought:  The premises are (cardiovascular exercise -> overall well-being), (staying up late -> feeling tired), and (cardiovascular exercise | feeling tired). The goal is to prove (overall well-being | -staying up late). I can use the premise (cardiovascular exercise | feeling tired) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'cardiovascular exercise' is true, then 'overall well-being' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (overall well-being | -staying up late) true. In the second case, if 'feeling tired' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (staying up late -> -overall well-being). From this, 'feeling tired' being true means '-overall well-being' is true, which also makes the conclusion (overall well-being | -staying up late) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
