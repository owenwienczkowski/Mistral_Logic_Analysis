Context: If an individual wakes up early, they will avoid traffic. Conversely, if they get a flat tire, they will miss work. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either John wakes up early or he will work. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) He avoids traffic and (b) He does not get a flat tire"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (wakes up early -> avoid traffic), (flat tire -> -work), and (wakes up early | work). The goal is to prove (avoid traffic | -flat tire). I can use the premise (wakes up early | work) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'wakes up early' is true, then 'avoid traffic' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. In the second case, if 'work' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (work -> -flat tire). From this, 'work' being true means '-flat tire' is true, which also makes the conclusion (avoid traffic | -flat tire) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
FINAL ANSWER: YES

Context: If P, Q. Conversely, if R, -S. It is known that at least one of the following statements is true: either P or S. However, the actual veracity of either statement remains ambiguous, as it could be the case that only the first statement is true, only the second statement is true, or both statements are true.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) -Q and (b) -S"
Let's think step by step.
Thought: The premises are (P -> Q), (R -> -S), and (P | S). The goal is to determine if (-Q | -S) must be true. I will try to find a counterexample where the premises are true but the conclusion is false. For the conclusion (-Q | -S) to be false, both Q and S must be true. Assuming this, we can check the premises: if S is true, then R must be false for the second premise (R -> -S) to hold. If Q is true, we can assume P is true to satisfy the first premise (P -> Q). This assignment also satisfies the third premise, (P | S), since both P and S are true. So, a counterexample exists where P is true, Q is true, S is true, and R is false. Since all premises can be true while the conclusion is false, the conclusion is not guaranteed.

Context: If an individual chooses to ride the elevator, they will reach their destination more quickly, whereas if they opt to climb the stairs, they will find themselves short of breath. Interestingly, we can infer that at least one of two situations is true: either Ava takes the elevator or she will not experience any breathlessness. Importantly, it remains ambiguous whether only one of these situations is true, or if both are indeed accurate.
Question: Can we say at least one of the following must always be true? (a) she will arrive quickly and (b) she climbs the stairs.
Let's think step by step.
Thought:  The premises are (elevator -> quickly), (stairs -> breathless), and (elevator | breathless). The goal is to prove (quickly | stairs). I can use the premise (elevator | breathless) to check both possible cases. In the first case, if 'elevator' is true, then 'quickly' must also be true, which makes the conclusion (quickly | stairs) true. In the second case, if 'breathless' is true, I must use the contrapositive of the second premise, which is (breathless -> -stairs). From this, 'breathless' being true means '-stairs' is true, which also makes the conclusion (quickly | stairs) true. Since the conclusion holds in both possible scenarios, it is logically guaranteed.
